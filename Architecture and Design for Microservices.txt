## Part 2: Architecture and Design for Microservices

1. Theory Question

a. Benefits and Challenges of Microservices vs. Monolithic Architecture

Microservices Benefits:

* Scalability: Individual services can be scaled independently based on their needs.
* Agility:  Smaller services are easier to develop, deploy, and update.
* Fault Isolation: Issues in one service are less likely to impact others.
* Tech Stack Flexibility: Different services can use different programming languages and frameworks.

Microservices Challenges:

* Complexity: Distributed systems introduce additional complexity in development, deployment, and monitoring.
* Development Overhead:  Managing multiple services requires more coordination and communication.
* Testing:  Testing interactions between services can be intricate.
* Infrastructure Costs:  Running and managing multiple services can be more expensive.

Monolithic Benefits:

* Simplicity: Easier to develop, deploy, and manage with a single codebase.
* Performance:  Direct communication within the application can be faster.
* Testing:  Straightforward to perform end-to-end testing.

Monolithic Challenges:

* Scalability: Scaling the entire application can be cumbersome.
* Flexibility: Modifications to one part can impact the entire system.
* Maintainability: As the application grows, complexity and maintenance difficulty increase.

Transitioning a QSR Online Ordering System:

* Start Small: Identify a well-defined service within the monolith (e.g., payment processing) and build it as a separate microservice.
* API Design: Design a clear and well-documented API for communication between microservices.
* Phased Migration: Gradually migrate functionalities to separate microservices over time.
* Data Consistency: Implement mechanisms to ensure data consistency across services.
* Monitoring:  Establish a comprehensive monitoring system to track performance and identify issues.


b. Key Considerations for a QSR Online Ordering System Design:

* Peak Load Handling: The system must be able to handle high order volumes during peak hours. Consider auto-scaling for backend services and databases.
* User Experience:  The ordering process should be user-friendly, fast, and intuitive across web and mobile platforms.
* POS System Integration: Integrate seamlessly with existing POS systems to streamline order processing and inventory management. Consider standardized APIs or middleware solutions.
* Security: Implement robust security measures to protect user data and financial information.
* Payment Processing: Integrate secure payment gateways for various payment methods.

Component Explanation:

* Web and Mobile Frontend:  User interfaces for placing orders through web and mobile applications.
* API Gateway:  Single entry point for API requests, routing them to appropriate backend services.
* Order Management Service: Handles order creation, tracking, and communication with POS systems.
* Menu Service: Provides menu information and manages product availability.
* User Management Service: Handles user authentication, registration, and user profile management.
* Payment Gateway: Processes online payments securely.
* Database: Stores order data, menu items, user information, and other system data.
* POS System: Existing point-of-sale system integrated for order fulfillment and inventory updates.

Communication Overview:

* Front-end applications interact with the API gateway using REST API calls.
* The API gateway routes requests to relevant backend services (Order Management, Menu, User Management).
* Services communicate with each other using message queues or a service mesh for asynchronous communication.
* Each service interacts with the database for data persistence and retrieval.
* The Order Management service integrates with the POS system for order fulfillment.
